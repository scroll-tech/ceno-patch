//!
//! An implementation of the types needed for [`CurveArithmetic`].
//!
//! [`CurveArithmetic`] is a trait that is used in [RustCryptos ECDSA](https://github.com/RustCrypto/signatures).
//!
//! [`CurveArithmetic`] contains all the types needed to implement the ECDSA algorithm over some
//! curve.
//!
//! This implementation is specifically for use inside of SP1, and internally uses SP1's Weierstrass
//! precompiles. Weierstrass precompiles.
//!
//! In summary, SP1 overrides curve arithmetic entirely, and patches upstream field operations
//! to be more efficient in the VM, such as `sqrt` or `inverse`.
